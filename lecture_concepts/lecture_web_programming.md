# Web Programming

Document Object Model (DOM) = an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents.

**Why do we need API for HTML?** 

HTML has to be interactive, not static, responding to click in real-time.

API is to interact with HTML via JavaScript.

DOM = a tree of elements: `<html>` splited into `<head>` and `<body>`, then `<a>`, `<h1>`, text, etc.

DOM defines logical structure as the HTML turned to data structure.

**Why does the structure of DOM matter?** 

To interact with objects in other programs

W3C Document Object Model = platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of a document.

**Problems**: static nature --> **Solutions**:
- add intelligence to the client --> JavaScript, Applets with in HTML pages
- add intelligence to the server --> CGI, Servlet, ASP, JSP, PHP
